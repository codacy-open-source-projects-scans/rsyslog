Plugin template type
====================

.. summary-start

Delegates string generation to a plugin for maximum performance.
Configuration selects the plugin by name.
.. summary-end

In plugin templates, the output string is generated by a plugin (also
called a *string generator*). The format is fixed as coded in the plugin,
which offers high performance at the cost of flexibility. The template
parameter ``plugin`` specifies the generator name, and the plugin must be
loaded before use.

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: none

   template(name="tpl4" type="plugin" plugin="mystrgen")

Refer to the plugin's documentation for further details.
