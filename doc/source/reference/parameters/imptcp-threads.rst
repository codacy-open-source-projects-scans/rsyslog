.. summary-start

Sets the number of helper threads that pull data off the network.

:Name: Threads
:Scope: module
:Type: integer
:Default: module=2
:Required?: no
:Introduced: at least 5.x, possibly earlier

Description
-----------
Number of helper worker threads to process incoming messages. These
threads are utilized to pull data off the network. On a busy system,
additional helper threads (but not more than there are CPUs/Cores)
can help improving performance. The default value is two, which means
there is a default thread count of three (the main input thread plus
two helpers). No more than 16 threads can be set (if tried to,
rsyslog always resorts to 16).
