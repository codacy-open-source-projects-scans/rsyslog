About rsyslog
=============

rsyslog is more than just a logging daemon â€” it is a **high-performance,
modular logging framework** with a lineage going back to the original
BSD `syslogd` (1983). Over the decades, it has evolved into a modern
log processing and observability platform that powers Linux systems,
cloud-native pipelines, and enterprise-scale deployments.

This section provides background on the project, its history, and
strategic direction, including our **AI First** initiative.
