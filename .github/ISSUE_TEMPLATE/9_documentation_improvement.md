**✍️ Love to contribute directly?**

Our documentation uses **Sphinx** and resides in the **`/doc` folder** of this repository. Small corrections or additions are often very easy to do directly via GitHub's web editor and a pull request! We truly appreciate contributions, and even minor doc changes are a great way to get involved and leave your mark in the commit history.
