# This wrapper retries the shared skeleton once more when TCP timing
# races trigger the known flake. Keeping the configuration identical
# between attempts mirrors the original scenario while providing extra
# tolerance. Additional hardening ideas include teaching minitcpsrvr to
# gate simulated disconnects on explicit acknowledgements and extending
# diag helpers so tests can block until omfwd reports an emptied action
# queue before sequence checks run.
#
# Follow-on tasks to explore:
#   - Introduce a deterministic omfwd load-balancer fixture that can
#     delay reconnect acceptance until buffers are flushed, enabling
#     more predictable recovery windows.
#   - Add diagnostics from omfwd (e.g. stats counters) to the testbench
#     logs so future flakes can be correlated with internal retry state.
